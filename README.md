🕹️ Tic Tac Toe - Web Application
This is a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a 3x3 grid where two players can take turns playing as X and O. The game handles user clicks, tracks the current player, checks for winning combinations, and detects draw conditions. It also includes a reset button to restart the game at any time. The layout is responsive and easy to use, providing a clean and interactive experience. This project is great for beginners learning DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic using JavaScript in a front-end web development environment.
